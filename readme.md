# CoreDraw tools for preparing files for plotter cutting
This tiny plugins package will be useful for those, who prepare files for kiss-cut and die-cut postpress operations.
Stickers, shaped cards, boxes etc. But in first place - it's about sheet printing.
Main features are:
- creating and optimizing table-view layouts (rectangular stickers without gap);
- zig-zag style imposition of shapes for minimizing plotter movements;
- optimizing complex shapes for best knife performance.
